CHAPTER 17. DCACHE WEBADMIN INTERFACE
=====================================

[Installation](https://www.dcache.org/manuals/Book-2.16/config/cf-webadmin-install-fhs.shtml)

This part describes how to configure the WEBADMIN service which runs inside the DOMAIN-HTTPD and offers additional features to admins like sending admin-commands equal to those of admin interface (CLI) to chosen cells or displaying billing plots.

For authentication and authorisation it offers usage of username/password (currently the kpwd-Plugin) or grid certificate talking to CELL-GPLAZMA2. It also offers a non-authenticated read-only mode.

If you are logged in as admin it is possible to send a command to multiple pools or a whole poolgroup in one go. It is even possible to send a command to any DCACHE cell. Also, there is information like their size, their id and used space on linkgroups and spacetokens available.

From the technical point of view the WEBADMIN service uses a Jetty-Server which is embedded in an ordinary CELL-HTTPD cell. It is using apache-wicket (a webfrontend-framework) and YAML (a CSS-Template Framework).

Installation
============

For the authenticated mode a configured CELL-GPLAZMA is required (see also [???]). The user may either authenticate by presenting his grid certificate or by entering a valid username/password combination. This way it is possible to login even if the user does not have a grid certificate. For a non-authenticated WEBADMIN service you just need to start the CELL-HTTPD service.

For the authenticated mode using a grid certificate the host certificate has to be imported into the DCACHE-keystore. In the grid world host certificates are usually signed by national Grid-CAs. Refer to the documentation provided by the Grid-CA to find out how to request a certificate. To import them into the DCACHE-keystore use this command:

    PROMPT-ROOT PATH-ODB-N-Sdcache import hostcert

Now you have to initialise your truststore (this is the certificate-store used for the SSL connections) by using this command:

    PROMPT-ROOT PATH-ODB-N-Sdcache import cacerts

The WEBADMIN service uses the same truststore as WEBDAV service, so you can skip this step if you have WEBDAV configured with SSL.

The default instance name is the name of the host which runs the httpdDomain and the default http port number is `2288` (this is the default port number of the HTTPD service). Now you should be able to have a read-only access to the webpage <http://example.com:2288/webadmin>.

In the following example we will enable the authenticated mode.

    [httpdDomain]
          authenticated=true

The most important value is `httpd.authz.admin-gid`, because it configures who is allowed to alter DCACHE behaviour, which certainly should not be everyone:

    # # When a user has this GID he can become an admin for the webadmin interface #
    httpd.authz.admin-gid=0

To see all webadmin specific property values have a look at `PATH-ODS-USD/defaults/httpd.properties`.

For information on CELL-GPLAZMA configuration have a look at [???][1] and for a special example [???].
